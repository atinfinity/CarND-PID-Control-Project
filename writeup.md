# CarND-Controls-PID

## Project Submission
1. Clone/fork the project's template files from the [project repository](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Controls-PID) and have a look at the [rubric here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/824/view). (Note: Please do not submit your project as a pull request against our repo!)
2. Build a PID controller and tune the PID hyperparameters by applying the general processing flow as described in the previous lessons.
3. Test your solution on the simulator!
4. When the vehicle is able to drive successfully around the track, submit! Remember to include a file addressing the reflection portion of the project in .txt, .md, .html, or .pdf format.
5. Try to see how fast you get the vehicle to **SAFELY** go!

## [Rubric Points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/824/view)
### Compilation
- Your code should compile.

### Implementation
- The PID procedure follows what was taught in the lessons.

### Reflection
- Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.
- Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.

### Simulation
- The vehicle must successfully drive a lap around the track.
